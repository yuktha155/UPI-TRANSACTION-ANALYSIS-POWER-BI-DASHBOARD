# UPI-TRANSACTION-ANALYSIS-POWER-BI-DASHBOARD
 
OVERVIEW
This project is part of my Data Analyst learning journey through a Udemy course. I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze UPI transactions, applying skills in data preparation, DAX, and visualization design.
The dashboard allows users to explore transaction patterns, balances, and trends using slicers, visuals, and bookmarks for a smooth experience.

ABOUT THE DATASET 
This dataset came from a Udemy Data Analyst course I took.
I’m not uploading the original file here (since it’s part of the course), but here’s a quick idea of what it looked like:
Around 20k rows of UPI transactions
Had details like:
Transaction ID, Date, Amount
Sending & Receiving Bank
Balance left after each transaction
Customer info (City, Gender, Age)
Transaction Type (Payment / Transfer), Status (Success / Fail)
Device used, Payment Method (QR / UPI ID / Phone Number), Merchant, Purpose
Currency

NOTE: IT’S ALL SAMPLE DATA FOR LEARNING, NOT REAL UPI TRANSACTIONS.


TOOLS AND SKILLS USED

Power BI Desktop
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for adding age column 
Data Profiling & Cleaning
Interactive Visual Design

STEPS INVOLVED 

Loading Data into Power BI Desktop
Data Profiling to check for quality and structure
Designing and formatting Slicers (size, position, formatting)
Adding an Age Column using DAX
Creating Visuals:Line Chart (transaction trends) ,AMatrix Visual (detailed breakdown)
Syncing Slicers across multiple pages
Applying Conditional Formatting to highlight key values
Adding Bookmarks for quick navigation (Remaining Balance & Transactions view)
